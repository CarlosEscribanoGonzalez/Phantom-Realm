# Phantom Realm

**Phantom Realm** is a first-person zombie shooter and my first project in **Unity 3D**. This work was developed for the course **Game Development Process** during my second year of university.

### About the Project

The main objective of this assignment was to create a video game while following proper group organization based on agile techniques, specifically **SCRUM**. The development of the game itself was secondary to the work, which placed much greater emphasis on the development process than on the final product. As a result, the game lacks content and is far from being a finished product.

### Features
- First-person shooter gameplay.
- Developed using Unity 3D.
- Focus on the development process and agile methodologies.

### Technologies
- **Unity 3D**
